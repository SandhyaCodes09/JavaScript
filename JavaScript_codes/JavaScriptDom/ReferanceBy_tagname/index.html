        <section class="post-content">
            <p>In today's digital landscape, less is often more. Minimalist web design has emerged as a powerful approach to creating engaging, user-friendly websites that focus on what truly matters: content and user experience.</p>
            
            <h2>Core Principles of Minimalist Design</h2>
            
            <p>Minimalist design isn't just about removing elements—it's about purposeful simplicity. Every element on the page should serve a specific function and contribute to the overall user experience.</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Use plenty of white space to create breathing room</li>
                <li>Choose a limited color palette for consistency</li>
                <li>Select clean, readable typography</li>
                <li>Prioritize essential content and functionality</li>
                <li>Embrace simplicity in navigation and layout</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>By following these principles, designers can create websites that are not only visually appealing but also highly functional and accessible to all users. The result is a seamless experience that allows content to shine without unnecessary distractions.</p>
